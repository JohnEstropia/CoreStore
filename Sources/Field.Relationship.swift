    Initializes the metadata for the relationship. All relationships require an "inverse", so updates to to this object's relationship are also reflected on its destination object. Make sure to declare this relationship's inverse relationship on its destination object. Due to Swift's compiler limitation, only one of the relationship and its inverse can declare an `inverse:` argument.

     - parameter keyPath: the permanent name for this relationship.
     - parameter minCount: the minimum number of objects in this relationship UNLESS THE RELATIONSHIP IS EMPTY. This means there might be zero objects in the relationship, which might be less than `minCount`. If the number of objects in the relationship do not satisfy `minCount` and `maxCount`, the transaction's commit (or auto-commit) would fail with a validation error.
     - parameter maxCount: the maximum number of objects in this relationship. If the number of objects in the relationship do not satisfy `minCount` and `maxCount`, the transaction's commit (or auto-commit) would fail with a validation error.
     - parameter deleteRule: defines what happens to relationship when an object is deleted. Valid values are `.nullify`, `.cascade`, and `.delete`. Defaults to `.nullify`.
     - parameter versionHashModifier: used to mark or denote a property as being a different "version" than another even if all of the values which affect persistence are equal. (Such a difference is important in cases where the properties are unchanged but the format or content of its data are changed.)
     - parameter previousVersionKeyPath: used to resolve naming conflicts between models. When creating an entity mapping between entities in two managed object models, a source entity property's `keyPath` with a matching destination entity property's `previousVersionKeyPath` indicate that a property mapping should be configured to migrate from the source to the destination. If unset, the identifier will be the property's `keyPath`.
     - parameter affectedByKeyPaths: a set of key paths for properties whose values affect the value of the receiver. This is similar to `NSManagedObject.keyPathsForValuesAffectingValue(forKey:)`.
