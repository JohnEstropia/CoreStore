Make sure to declare this relationship's inverse relationship on its destination object. Due to Swift's compiler limitation, only one of the relationship and its inverse can declare an `inverse:` argument.

         - parameter keyPath: the permanent name for this relationship.
         - parameter minCount: the minimum number of objects in this relationship UNLESS THE RELATIONSHIP IS EMPTY. This means there might be zero objects in the relationship, which might be less than `minCount`. If the number of objects in the relationship do not satisfy `minCount` and `maxCount`, the transaction's commit (or auto-commit) would fail with a validation error.
         - parameter maxCount: the maximum number of objects in this relationship. If the number of objects in the relationship do not satisfy `minCount` and `maxCount`, the transaction's commit (or auto-commit) would fail with a validation error.
         - parameter inverse: the inverse relationship that is declared for the destination object. All relationships require an "inverse", so updates to to this object's relationship are also reflected on its destination object.
         - parameter deleteRule: defines what happens to relationship when an object is deleted. Valid values are `.nullify`, `.cascade`, and `.delete`. Defaults to `.nullify`.
         - parameter versionHashModifier: used to mark or denote a relationship as being a different "version" than another even if all of the values which affect persistence are equal. (Such a difference is important in cases where the properties are unchanged but the format or content of its data are changed.)
         - parameter renamingIdentifier: used to resolve naming conflicts between models. When creating an entity mapping between entities in two managed object models, a source entity property and a destination entity property that share the same identifier indicate that a property mapping should be configured to migrate from the source to the destination. If unset, the identifier will be the property's name.
         - parameter affectedByKeyPaths: a set of key paths for properties whose values affect the value of the receiver. This is similar to `NSManagedObject.keyPathsForValuesAffectingValue(forKey:)`.
