/**
 `DynamicSchema` are types that provide `NSManagedObjectModel` instances for a single model version. CoreStore currently supports the following concrete types:
 - `XcodeDataModelSchema`: describes models loaded from a .xcdatamodeld file.
 - `UnsafeDataModelSchema`: describes models loaded directly from an existing `NSManagedObjectModel`. It is not advisable to continue using this model as its metadata are not available to CoreStore.
 - `CoreStoreSchema`: describes models written for `CoreStoreObject` Swift class declarations.
