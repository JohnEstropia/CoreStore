The `Result` argument of the closure will either wrap the return value of `task`, or any uncaught errors thrown from within `task`. Cancelled `task`s will be indicated by `.failure(error: CoreStoreError.userCancelled)`. Custom errors thrown by the user will be wrapped in `CoreStoreError.userError(error: Error)`.

This results in lower risk for deadlocks, but the updated data may not have been propagated to the `DataStack` after returning. Defaults to `true`.
