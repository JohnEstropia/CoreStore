     Returns this object's parent `UnsafeDataTransaction` instance if it was created from one. Returns `nil` if the parent transaction is either an `AsynchronousDataTransaction` or a `SynchronousDataTransaction`, or if the object is not managed by CoreStore.
     
     When using an `UnsafeDataTransaction` and passing around a temporary object, you can use this property to execute fetches and updates to the transaction without having to pass around both the object and the transaction instances.
     
     - Important: The internal reference to the transaction is `weak`, and it is still the developer's responsibility to retain a strong reference to the `UnsafeDataTransaction`.
