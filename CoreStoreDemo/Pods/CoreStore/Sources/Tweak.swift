/**
 The `Tweak` clause allows fine-tuning the `NSFetchRequest` for a fetch or query.
 Sample usage:
 ```
 let employees = transaction.fetchAll(
     From<MyPersonEntity>(),
     Tweak { (fetchRequest) -> Void in
         fetchRequest.includesPendingChanges = false
         fetchRequest.fetchLimit = 5
     }
 )
 ```

    /**
     Initializes a `Tweak` clause with a closure where the `NSFetchRequest` may be configured.
     
     - Important: `Tweak`'s closure is executed only just before the fetch occurs, so make sure that any values captured by the closure is not prone to race conditions. Also, some utilities (such as `ListMonitor`s) may keep `FetchClause`s in memory and may thus introduce retain cycles if reference captures are not handled properly.
